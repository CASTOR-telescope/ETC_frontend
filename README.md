# CASTOR ETC GUI Frontend

Isaac Cheng - 2022

This repository is for the  graphical user interface (GUI) frontend for the CASTOR
Exposure Time Calculator (ETC). This is meant to be used with the CASTOR ETC Python
backend.

---

## Dependencies

CASTOR frontend uses [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and
[React](https://reactjs.org/) for the ETC GUI. We bridge this GUI with the CASTOR ETC
Python backend using an application programming interface (API) created using the
[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) microframework.
